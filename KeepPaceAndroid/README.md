The Keep Pace app is an offline running APP. This APP is designed to estimate user's finish time during various walking, jogging, and running events: 5K, 10K, 1/2 Marathon, and full Marathon. Additionally, users will have the option of using this APP to estimate their finish time on the famous Grouse Grind Train in BC. This APP will track the runner current running time while simultaneously estimating their finish time in kilometer or miles. However, this APP is designed without using GPS service, which saves the user's device a significant amount of batter power. Fitness enthusiasts of all ages can use this APP on both Android and IOS platforms to reach their fitness goals.
